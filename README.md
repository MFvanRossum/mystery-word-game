# Mystery Word

Mystery Word is a spin on the classic game, Hangman, built in Python and played in the Terminal. 

The Player plays against the computer, which selects a random word from a pre-sourced list of words. The mystery word's length varies based on the difficulty selected by the Player. The Player has a specified amount of turns to guess letters, which fill in the blanks of the mystery word. The Player can also request hints for "freebie" letters. The number of hints available depends on the selected difficulty. 

Mystery Word was created as an assignment for Momentum Learning's Immersive Full Stack Development Course.

It can be played by running the command 'python3 game.py' in the terminal after cloning this repository.
